# Where the app is

# My GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID

# My GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

# How it works
I had the 13b.-example as a local folder, exported my ID and SECRET variables, to the OS env,
then was able to access the localhost:5000 website and log-in with google. I don't know what 
else to add here, it all worked, and I added a screenshot as proof!
