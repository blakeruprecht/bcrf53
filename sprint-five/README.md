I have gotten the Dex and the Google SSO to work, as seen in the
`my-google` folder.

Hey y'all, I haven't been able to finish this yet, I've run into
problems with not being able to make the Dex app. I ended up 
encountering a fatal error: file not found within the security
framework headers within my command line tools, causing an error
with the command `make`. Because of this, I've spent 7 hours today
attempting to solve this problem. 

I have a ton of search history trying to figure out where the
security/CSCommon.h file could possibly be located, but after 
checking every related directory, and reading stack overflow, the 
issues on Golang, reinstalling Golang twice, reinstalling the .git 
more than 5 times, removing my package manager on mac, attempting 
to install dex.git from the master branch, attempting to run 
Ubuntu in a virtual machine, rebooting my laptop twice, and 
watching all related class vimeos, have I decidedto call it quits 
for the night.

With that being said, I 100% plan to finish this project by 
tomorrow, and would really appreciate some leniency for grading.
I just finished a massive report that took me all week earlier
today, so I was delayed in starting.
