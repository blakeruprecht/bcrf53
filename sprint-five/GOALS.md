## Goals of the App
The goal of my app will be to help me learn about data collection, so I intend
to collect as much weird data as possible and display it to the users. In essence,
this will be a "lookie at what I can do" type of web app, where users can see
what data they're giving up by different types of logins.

## Core Audience
The core audience is people who are interested in data, data privacy, and where
their data is going.

## Data Collection
As much as possible. What can a random person collect about you? Name, photo,
email, what else? That's what I hope to see. All of this will be displayed to the
user in an educational format.
