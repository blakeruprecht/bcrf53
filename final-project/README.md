## Assignment 13c Info

#### Moved from other fork
I moved this project from my fork of MU-Software Engineering to this repo.

#### Changed Goal
I've changed the goal of my app, because my last goal (display data from login) proved to be really
simple and boring. Displaying the data that SSO tracks would be trivial, and is basically already
done by the example app.  

### New Goal
Instead, I have a new goal. To display local food and drink prices (okay,
mainly just beer). What this means, is the app now displays drink deals, and by next week, will
allow users to add deals to the list. This took me quite a while to figure out, since I've never
done anything like this before, but it's looking pretty interesting so far!

## Running the App
Same as before,  
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=734280250142-hrm6r40r4002l4oc6augb6gg3hj4fcdg.apps.googleusercontent.com  
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=5mSP9__DRZL_LXVHheJsGgEZ  
`python app.py`
and it's up and running.

The "deals" section is located at "localhost:5000/deals"
