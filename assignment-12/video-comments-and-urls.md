# Sprint 3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Video Discussion summary
- A lot of time was spent discussing the template, and making sure the format 
  was correct
    - I can tell that standardizing formats is really important, which is 
      surprising to me
- I thought that PR #334 was a shoe-in for inclusion, but the point about how 
  inactivity isn't necessarily a bad thing, and without the context can't be 
  explained, did not immediately jump into my head. I appreciated how this was
  viewed from multiple different angles.
- I can see why there was so much "nitpicky" discussion around the pull request,
  it was necessary to ensure that it was viewed from all angles
