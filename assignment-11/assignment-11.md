# Working Group Reflections

Working Group I attended: VALUE, APR-09

- "Determination of value is critical, but not well understood"
- "We need to be able to clearly articulate the audience that's answering the survey"
- "I think that's the nature of bullshit!"

- How do you convince companies to value open source when we don't have a proper value metric?

- Hard to analogize between open source and other value-bring opportunities

- I would be interested in seeing more research on this "value metric", what it entails, 
  and how it goes beyond just measuring short term capital gains. Could be useful for more than
  the OSS community, e.g. economics (I'm sure there's some work here already)

- How do we line up with business people?

- This metric idea is fascinating. I really like how it has to appeal to both business and engineering
  types, two different grouops that cross over a lot but attack problems from very different directions.

# Podcast Reflections

- I'm interested in how so many of these people in the podcast justify their jobs 
  in open source and find jobs in open source becuase of the community and what they've learned how to do
  
- I really like the idea of open source software, and I think one important aspect of it that I haven't heard
  mentioned surrounding CHAOSS is keeping code efficient simple, minimal, and frugal. That is, making sure 
  code doesn't complex, error-prone, or slow.
  
- Based on the fact that I have no clue how free open source stuff gets funded, I would like to attend the VALUE
  meeting to try and figure this out.
