Working Group I plan to attend: VALUE

# Podcast Reflections

- I'm interested in how so many of these people in the podcast justify their jobs 
  in open source and find jobs in open source becuase of the community and what they've learned how to do
  
- I really like the idea of open source software, and I think one important aspect of it that I haven't heard
  mentioned surrounding CHAOSS is keeping code efficient simple, minimal, and frugal. That is, making sure 
  code doesn't complex, error-prone, or slow.
  
- Based on this, I plan to listen in to the Evolution working group meeting, this Wednesday.
