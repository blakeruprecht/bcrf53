There's obviously tons of reasons to participate in open source, but I really saw
a big divide between extrinsic and intrinsic reasons. The extrinsic reasons are things
like money, peer-recognition, building marketable skills, reputation, and altruism.
The work is done almost in spite of the person doing the work. There are more important
things at stake then the work itself. The other side of the coin is intrinsic motivation.
Things like pursuing passion projects, having fun, and just generally doing the work for
the sake of the work itself, with almost disregard for external factors. This is the type
of motivation that interests me the most, because in a very real way these people are 
artists, creating for the world because they can. There's something magical in that, and
I'm not sure if it's appreciated enough. Allowing people avenues to perform their peak
work would be a big benefit to society, and open source is currently one of those avenues
where the work can be directly reviewed and still of benefit to society.
