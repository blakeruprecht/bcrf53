For most things in my computer science career so far, I've use the GNU General Purpose License.
Since I strongly agree with GNU philosophy, and love the idea of temporally permissible
open source, I will stick with GNU. That way whatever I create, must legally stay open source
forever. Open source should stay that way, but of course, that's just like, my opinion man.
